Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start: May 15, 2024, 08:00 UTC
End: May 15, 2024, 10:30 UTC
Impact:
Our online retail website was completely down, showing "500 Internal Server Error" messages. Customers couldn't browse products or make purchases, impacting about 90% of our users during this time.
Root Cause:
A critical database server ran out of disk space due to a sudden spike in transaction logs, which caused the website to fail when trying to retrieve data.
Timeline:

08:00 UTC: Issue detected by monitoring systems, showing "500 Internal Server Error" messages.
08:05 UTC: On-call engineer received the alert and began investigating.
08:10 UTC: Initial investigation focused on the web application servers, thinking there might be an issue with the application code.
08:20 UTC: Found that web application servers were working fine; shifted focus to the database server.
08:30 UTC: Database admin team brought in to check the database server.
08:40 UTC: Discovered that the database server was out of disk space.
08:45 UTC: Attempted to restart database server services, but it didn't solve the issue.
09:00 UTC: Escalated the incident to the infrastructure team to add more storage.
09:15 UTC: Additional disk space was allocated to the database server.
09:30 UTC: Database server back online, but website still had issues due to cache inconsistencies.
09:45 UTC: Cleared and restarted web servers and cache.
10:00 UTC: Website started recovering and became accessible to users.
10:30 UTC: Full service restored, confirmed via monitoring tools and user feedback.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The database server ran out of disk space because of a massive increase in transaction logs. This was triggered by an unexpectedly high number of transactions from a promotional campaign that the current setup wasn't prepared to handle.
Resolution:
We allocated more disk space to the database server to get it running again. Then, we cleared and restarted the web servers and cache to ensure everything was working correctly.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements and Fixes:

Disk Space Monitoring: Improve our monitoring to get early warnings when disk space is low on database servers.
Scalable Storage Solutions: Implement scalable storage to handle unexpected surges in data.
Database Maintenance: Regularly archive and clean up old transaction logs to keep the system running smoothly.
Load Testing: Perform load testing under different scenarios, including during promotions, to better anticipate and manage high traffic.
Specific Tasks:

Upgrade Monitoring Tools: Enhance our monitoring tools to alert us about disk space issues well before they become critical.
Implement Auto-Scaling: Set up auto-scaling for database storage to automatically handle sudden data spikes.
Archive Logs: Schedule regular archiving of old transaction logs to free up space.
Conduct Load Testing: Schedule and perform load tests, especially before major promotions or events.
Update Incident Playbooks: Update our incident response playbooks to include steps for dealing with database disk space issues.
Training Sessions: Provide training for our operations and database teams on the new monitoring and scaling procedures.
By making these improvements, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and improve our response time when issues do arise.
